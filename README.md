# Amazing Gatsby website

Repository containing code for my personal website at https://daviddonahue.netlify.com

## How was it made?

This website was made using a combination of HTML, CSS, and React, powered by the Gatsby platform and hosted on netlify.com.

Most presentation elements of the website were made using HTML with CSS elements for styling. React was used to form the main shell of the program, and to implement social media icons and special features. Overall, the code is not well organized as I was learning react for the first time.
